This is a website for Mac's Estate Sale Services, a local company run by a friend of mine who has asked me to design a web presence for him. Currently the only online information he has available is through his eBay store where he sells his merchandise.  He eventually wants numerous features, but will be accepting an informational page to be up and running immediately.  Following are the items for eventual inclusion:

    1 - Informational web page
            Includes sections describing his business, i.e. who he is, what he does where to contact him, customer testimonials, and contact information, including access to third party sales site for merchandise.git

    2 - online store    
            E-commerce features such as inventory view, shopping cart / checkout, payment processing, necessary security features

    3 - online auction hosting
            Eventually he would like to hold his own online auctions.  Many features of this overlap with the store functionality.  Not sure which hosting platform achieves this the best, research must be done.
